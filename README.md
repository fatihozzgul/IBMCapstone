SpaceX is a game-changing company in the space industry, offering rocket launches at a significantly lower cost compared to other providers by reusing the first stage of the launch. As a data scientist working for a startup rivaling SpaceX, the project goal is to develop a machine learning pipeline to predict the landing outcome of the first stage in the future. This prediction is essential in identifying the optimal price to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

The project consists of several steps, including data collection through API and web scraping, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis using SQL and visualization, interactive visual analytics using Folium, and a dashboard application. The machine learning pipeline is developed to make predictions based on the collected data, enabling the startup to make informed decisions when bidding against SpaceX.

The project culminates in a final presentation that summarizes the findings and recommendations for the startup's bidding strategy against SpaceX.
